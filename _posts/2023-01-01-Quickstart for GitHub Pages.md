Introduction

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style.

This guide will lead you through creating a user site at username.github.io.
Creating your website

    In the upper-right corner of any page, select 

, then click New repository.

Enter username.github.io as the repository name. Replace username with your GitHub username. For example, if your username is octocat, the repository name should be octocat.github.io.

Under your repository name, click
Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the

dropdown menu, then click Settings.

In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click

    Pages.

    Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select Deploy from a branch.

    Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source. Screenshot of Pages settings in a GitHub repository. A menu to select a branch for a publishing source, labeled "None," is outlined in dark orange.

    Optionally, open the README.md file of your repository. The README.md file is where you will write the content for your site. You can edit the file or keep the default content for now.

    Visit username.github.io to view your new website. Note that it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

Changing the title and description

By default, the title of your site is username.github.io. You can change the title by editing the _config.yml file in your repository. You can also add a description for your site.

    Click the Code tab of your repository.

    In the file list, click _config.yml to open the file.

    Click 

to edit the file.

The _config.yml file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line with title: followed by the title you want. Add a new line with description: followed by the description you want. For example:

theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
title: Octocat's homepage
description: Bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates!

When you are done editing the file, click Commit changes.
